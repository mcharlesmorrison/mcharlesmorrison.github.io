        <p><em>A must-have tool for any trad climbing adventure</em></p>

        <p>Nut tools are a standard piece of equipment for any trad rack. I didn't have one and was not prepared to shell any money out for one, so I made my own. I found some scrap aluminum in the shop, CAD'ed up some unique designs, and waterjet them on the OMAX. It is a pretty stanadard design, but my one claim to fame is the message the nut tool bears. It reminds the user to "Go Big!" every time he or she uses it. It has helped me many times while high up on a wall, quaking in my shoes with fear.</p>
