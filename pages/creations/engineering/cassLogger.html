        <p><em>A general purpose data logger</em></p>

        <p>The Cass Logger is a built-from-scratch data acquisition system that I made for my consulting company, Cass Labs. The goal of this project was to make a highly capable, highly customizable data logging system for engineering research and development. I mainly use it with clients in the bike industry, instrumenting road and mountain bikes (analog and electric) for in-field testing. I also use it as a general purpose logger for all my data acquisition needs. </p>

        <p>The system is built around the Teensy 4.1. It has 18 channels (which can be configured to be analog, digital, I2C, SPI, and CAN), a built-in 9 DoF IMU, an RTC (for global time management even when the device is powered off, helpful for syncing with external devices like Garmins and GoPros), and an integrated charging circuit. I designed the PCB from the ground up and also programmed the firmware from scratch (in C++). The logger can hit sampling frequencies above 5 kHz with the IMU disabled, and 2 kHz with it enabled. I typically run 500 Hz to be mindful of data storage costs.</p>

        <p>On top of the logger, I&rsquo;ve developed a suite of custom sensors (potentiometers, accelerometers, feedback buttons, infrared receivers, wheel speed sensors, quadrature encoders, and more) for various applications. The nice thing about the logger is I can design application-specific sensors super quickly that easily integrate with the system. </p>

        <p>In terms of software, I&rsquo;ve developed a CLI for extremely fast data transfer and an extensive python library for data ingestion and analysis. I developed a database architecture leveraging MondoDB and Cloudflare R2 services in order to store field test datasets over time for long-term comparison and trend analysis. With this entire ecosystem, I have solved the perpetual issue plaguing the bike industry of field test data becoming obsolete after mere days of testing due to improper metadata and data documentation, storage, and formatting.</p>
