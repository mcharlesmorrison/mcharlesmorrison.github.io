        <p><em>Record player built into a Redwood stump with audio digitization</em></p>

        <p>For my capstone design course I wanted to make something that I would keep. I had seen too many mech-e projects that get built out all semester only to be parted out when all was said and done. So after mulling over a few ideas, I decided to make a record player. Sounds pretty mundane, right? Well, I would build this record plater into a stump that I cut myself from the Santa Cruz mountains, and this record player would also digitize and save your records to mp3 files on your computer. Now it sounds a little more exciting. I owe my peers Sepehr and Albert a huge thanks for their contributions to the project, as well as a thanks to Jacob and Dennis from the Etcheverry machine shop, and Twiggy from Jacobs Hall.</p>

        <p>While not a revolution in terms of innovation, the project did allow me to deploy a wide range of skills I had accrued over my time at Berkeley. It would involve CAD/CAM, CNC work on both metal and wood, manual mill and lathe operations, waterjetting, firmware and software development, motor control, audio signal processing, UI/UX considerations, and more. A video of the project is shown below, as well as many more project details and photos.</p>

        <p>I started by finding a nice downed Redwood tree on my buddy Aaron&rsquo;s property. He was kind enough to help out with the search, and loaned me his chainsaw for the day. I brought the stump down to the lab and used marine epoxy to fill most of the gaps. This involved creating a duct tape barrier around it and letting the epoxy seep through the stump for several days.</p>

        <p>In the meantime, I tested hole sizes for bearings, worked on CAD, and developed toolpaths for the Shopbot CNC I would be using to cut the stump. It was a real challenge to figure out how to datum a super organic workpiece, there were no flat surfaces, no 90 degree edges, and the piece didn&rsquo;t even fit in the Shopbot without some encouragement. Eventually, after weeks of work and dozens of hours on the Shopbot, I had the stump cut out to spec. It involved a lot of complicated jigging, some dowel placement in order to be able to flip the piece over and over, and templates taped on top of the work surface.</p>

        <p>During all this time, I worked on fabricating the subassemblies, like the tone arm (which included an auto-stop feature to stop the record at the end of the album), all the metal components for the top of the piece, and the electronics housings. Albert helped a ton with figuring out all of the motor control stuff, and we also were able to figure out digitization. We were able to save the audio data real time to a microSD card on our microcontroller, and then read that data over serial to the computer and convert it to MP3 files.</p>

        <p>Eventually, it came time to assemble everything. I installed bearings, treated the wood with some stain and paste wax, installed all the subassemblies, and worked out various kinks. I housed all the electronics under the stump on a clear sheet of acrylic so that interested users could peer &ldquo;under the hood.&rdquo; It took about four months to go from concept to finished product, and I never want to make another record player again. </p>
