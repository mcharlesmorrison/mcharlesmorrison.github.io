        <p>My buddy Will and I wanted some practice with Fusion 360's CAM software, so we decided to make hangboards on the Shopbot CNC. For those unacquainted, hangboards are devices for improving finger and forearm strength for climbing. I designed the board in a couple of days, with various pocket depths and widths. Then I spent another couple days on toolpaths, and we were ready to go. We bought some Maple from the hardwood store, planed them, cut them, and glued them to get our desired thickness. After drying them, we threw mine on the shopbot and I spent then next few days in the lab cutting away. There were a few manual operations to be done once the CNC'ing was done, but pretty soon I had a hangboard up in my room. I'm not sure if Will ever got around to cutting his.</p>
