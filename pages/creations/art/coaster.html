        <p><em>Coasters made from redwood scrap wood</em></p>

        <p>There is a ton of scrap redwood around Aaron's place. So I like making random stuff when not feeling like building trails or riding bikes up there. I had the idea to make some sort of artpiece for Lexi for her graduation, and I also remember woodburning stuff at camp when I was a kid. So I busted out my soldering iron and started drawing some stuff on wood. After playing around for a bit, I used the tablesaw and router to make some nice coasters, and then woodburned various designs into them. For Lexi, I drew a redwood tree. And for my friend Kelly, who was just returning to California after living for several years in Switzerland, I made her a coaster with California's outline, and one with Switzerland's outline (which is not a very aesthetic outline).</p>
