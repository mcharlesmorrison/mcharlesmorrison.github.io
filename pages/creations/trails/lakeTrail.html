        <p><em>Multi-use trail for a summer camp in the Southern Sierras</em></p>

        I was contracted out to build this trail by a summer camp in the southern Sierra. I spent six weeks building this and Cutoff trail. The Lake trail was designed to be a more scenic alternative than the dirt road that leads down to the lake on the property. It winds its way circuitously through grasslands, groves Black Oaks and Manzanita. It is a multi-use trail for the camp, built for hikers, bikers, and horseback riders. 

        Similar to Cutoff trail, it mostly involved work with the flathead, and occasionally the pick and McLeod for bench cuts and berms. I had to trim back a lot of tree branches as well, since I wanted it to wind through as many scenic groves as possible.
