            <p>&ldquo;What do you mean they&rsquo;re not three for a dollar?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Where the hell did you hear they were three for a dollar, kid?&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>The kid pulled the newspaper out of the back pocket of his jeans and waved it in the older man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Here, mister! Right here!&rdquo; He said, pointing to the front page.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Ooooh, he-he-he, ho-ho-ho, a-ha-ha&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s overwhelming laugh turned into a cough, then back to a laugh again. When he had got his wits about him, the old man stood up from the creaky wooden chair that sat at the entrance of his humble produce store&mdash;the oldest store in town&mdash;lumbered a few feet over to the cashier stand, and grabbed an even creakier chair. He held it out to his perplexed company and asked, &ldquo;Well now, that&rsquo;s one hell of a misunderstanding. How long you got, kid? This is a story you&rsquo;re gonna wanna hear.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen, mister. Sure beats heading home empty-handed right now with no excuse for Ma. She&rsquo;ll probably whoop me somethin&rsquo; fierce no matter what.&rdquo; The kid took a seat in the chair next to the shop&rsquo;s proprietor. The old man slid over his tin cup, still half full with water. The kid gratefully gulped it down.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Well, kid, wasn&rsquo;t two weeks ago now that these little scoundrels came to the store. I knew somethin&rsquo; was off. Few reasons. One&#8230;&rdquo; The old man held up his crusty right hand in front of his face, extended his pointer finger, and tapped it with his left hand. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t recognize these kids. Had to be from outta town. I known everyone that is or ever was in this town. Now why these strangers passin&rsquo; through? Two&#8230;&rdquo; His middle finger shot up next to the pointer. &ldquo;These lil&rsquo; kids came first thing, right when I opened. Now it sure didn&rsquo;t seem like they was passin&rsquo; through on a drive, got hungry, and saw my shop by chance. No sir-ee, it seems like they were up to somethin&rsquo;&mdash;comin&rsquo; in at 6:30 like that. And three&#8230;&rdquo; His ring finger joined the other two, &ldquo;These kids looked real shifty. They were tryna act all casual. Real cool. You probably know, when you and your buddies are up to no good and someone comes a-strollin&rsquo; by. You think yer bein&rsquo; slick, but us old folks can see straight through ya! You&rsquo;ll learn though. In good time. Hell I was no different, gettin&rsquo; up to all sorts of trouble back in my day. You shoulda seen this town, was really truly the wild west back then. Hell of a place for to come of age.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Anyway. The hell was I? Oh yea, so for these reasons I was on high alert with those little rats. Knew they was up to somethin&rsquo;. They walked around, stalkin&rsquo; up and down the aisles. Little fellers they were though, maybe thirteen, fourteen year old. Three of them, ya know. So I get up, and shout out real loud, &lsquo;Mornin&rsquo; boyos! You just lemme know if you need help with somethin&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll fix ya right up! Say, y&rsquo;all from out of town?&rsquo; I talk real loud an confident like that whenever I be suspectin&rsquo; trouble. Works like a charm ya know, kid? I used it with big mean nasty sons-a-bitches in bars, with people tryna rob me, cheat me, people I see &lsquo;round town gettin&rsquo; up to no good. You just go right up, talk real loud and real nice so everyone can here. Freaks &lsquo;em out, no matter how tough a guy it is. There&rsquo;s gotta be a dozen times I shoulda got my ass a-whooped, but you just talk real, loud, real confident-like, and don&rsquo;t forget this, <em>real nice</em>, and Bob&rsquo;s yer damn uncle!</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Alright. The hell was I? So these boys. I ask &lsquo;em real loud where they from. One of them mutters something I can&rsquo;t even hear, another says &lsquo;mornin&rsquo;, mister&rsquo; and another don&rsquo;t say a damn thing. I could tell they were nervous little runts. So I kept a close eye on &lsquo;em, but real discreet, ya know? And sure enough, I saw it. Them little bastards was stealin&rsquo; produce! My produce! I kept it cool though. Saw one slip an apple into his pocket. Another, a few carrots. One of them, confident little rat, put a whole bushel of bananas in his big trench-coat-lookin&rsquo; jacket. Oh, and there&rsquo;s a fourth thing that tipped me off. lt was, what did I say, two, three weeks ago this happened? It&rsquo;s goddam August, what you need a winter coat on for in goddam August!</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;I watched &lsquo;em slip all those fruits and veggies in their pockets, got to have been a whole damn dollar&rsquo;s worth. By the way, I counted all the fruit up afterwards, and sure was just about a dollar&rsquo;s worth. Anyways, I didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; yet though, I waited to see what they was gonna do. Then they all of a sudden made for the exit. Nervously, of course. &lsquo;Thanks, mister.&rsquo; One of them said. So I got up, and just as the last one was &lsquo;bouta get out the door, I grabbed him. Wrapped my arm around his neck and choked the little guy, yellin&rsquo; at his buddies all the while &lsquo;You gimme my goddam produce back you rats! I saw what you took! I&rsquo;ll come for you two next!&rsquo; The one I had was squealin&rsquo; like a little pig. And these boys were such sorry little runts that the other two nearly wet themselves. They came right back to me like trained little pups. I let their friend go. He was a cryin&rsquo; wreck, pullin&rsquo; fruit out of his pockets and tossin&rsquo; it on the ground all willy nilly. For good measure I grabbed the other two boys&mdash;one in each arm&mdash;and gave them a good chokin&rsquo; too! Wanted to make sure they never thought about stealin&rsquo; from a man ever again! I made damn well sure of that, they gave me all of it back&mdash;all of them a-cryin&rsquo;&mdash;and they sped off faster than anything down that road outta town.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Old Pete was comin&rsquo; up just about then, you know old Pete don&rsquo;t ya? Buys a Coca-Cola from me every mornin&rsquo; at seven. &lsquo;Cept Sundays. Anyways, Pete saw the whole damn thing, got a good laugh out of it too. &lsquo;Boy you really showed them kids&rsquo; he said, slappin&rsquo; me on the shoulder after he walked up. We had a good laugh.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Well you know what happens next, kid? We live in a small town you know. Word spread quick. Sure enough, couple weeks later, they write a goddam front page story &lsquo;bout me. Sayin&rsquo; how some outta-towners came in, tried to steal some stuff from me. How I gave &lsquo;em a good lickin&rsquo; and scared &lsquo;em off. Anyways, that&rsquo;s what ya&rsquo; hold right there in yer damn hands. And that story right there is the source of what&rsquo;s gotta be the funniest damn misunderstanding I ever saw in my life.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>The kid smiled, and looked down at the headline in the paper: <em>Arty Chokes Three for a Dollar</em>.</p>
