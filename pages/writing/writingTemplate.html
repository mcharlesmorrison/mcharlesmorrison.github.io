        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Effective Altruism (EA) as a philosophy and political movement has been gaining in popularity and scope almost exponentially for several years. The unexpected demise of Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="#notes"><b>[0]</b></a>, one of the world&rsquo;s most famous &ldquo;Effective Altruists,&rdquo; and his legacy have finally cast some scrutiny on a movement that otherwise was considered by the public to be an unmitigated good. After all, who can argue against altruism, and it being carried out effectively?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originally, I intended to criticize EA on strictly philosophical grounds, analyzing the core axioms of its philosophy and exposing their deficiencies, but the recent FTX scandal has warranted an expansion of this essay&rsquo;s scope. I find it necessary now to also demonstrate EA&rsquo;s formidable and dangerous potential as a political entity. A close inspection of Effective Altruism both as a philosophy and as a political entity reveals that not only does it fail to &ldquo;do good better&rdquo; <a href="#notes"><b>[1]</b></a>, but also actively serves as a destructive global force.</span></p>
