        <p><em>October 2022</em></p>

        <p>After my bike’s shock snapped into sad little pieces on the Arizona Trail, John and I headed back to his place in Tahoe to regroup. John had taken a month off of work for us to ride the Arizona Trail, and we still had a week or so before he had to go back to the salt mines. I figured we might as well ride the Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT) as it seemed like a crime that John hadn’t yet done the whole thing even after living in the area for several years. Once my bike was operable again (thanks to Aaron for sending a new shock out my way), we set off for the TRT.</p>
        
        <p>This trip was novel in that we simply rolled out of John’s front door to start it off. Most big thru-hikes or bikepacking trips involve extremely complicated logistics, and so it was refreshing to do a multi-day ride involving no driving, easy resupplies every day, and plentiful water access throughout. The trail is extraordinarily well-marked and maintained by the finest trail stewards to ever walk the planet. The quality of trail was a welcomed relief after spending ten days bushwhacking our way through the remote deserts and highlands of Arizona. The TRT was practically a highway in comparison. In fact, some of the wilderness detours were highways!</p>        
        
        <p>We rolled out in the afternoon, and crushed a little over thirty miles of road riding to get up to Tahoe City. The miles and the hours flew by as we put down steady wattage along the well graded two-lane highway. We picked up a little food at the grocery store in town and then joined the Rim Trail proper. The climbing proved to be fun and engaging as it was consistently quite technical. As the sun set, we started scanning for good campsites. I had a hunch that a plateau I spotted just above us would offer flat campsites and great views. My suspicion was confirmed when I checked the area out, and we happily set up camp and knocked out for the night.</p>

        <p>I was climbing in Bishop that morning, so I didn&rsquo;t get down south to start the route until around noon. I parked my car just a few miles east of Independence, not wanting to risk driving my new whip (a 2003 Toyota Sienna, that replaced my 1999 Toyota Sienna) on rough dirt roads. This meant that I had about twenty-five miles to hike each way in order to complete the route. After eating a quick lunch and haphazardly packing my backpack (I almost forgot to bring my sleeping bag), I was off around one in the afternoon. I had about fifteen miles and five thousand feet of climbing to do before sunset, so I hiked at a good clip and didn&rsquo;t take any breaks. I really enjoyed the fact that most of this route was on old dirt roads; it allowed me to zone out, let my mind wander, and simply take in my surroundings. I had about six liters of water in tow, since there was none on this route, despite me lauding the plethora of water in the Inyos.</p>
        
        <p>I took a wrong turn at some point, and so I had to scramble up a scree field to make it to Badger Flat, my destination for the day. I arrived right at sunset, perfect timing. Unlike my last trip a few days before this one, I decided to bring a tent and one sleeping bag, instead of no tent and two sleeping bags. This new strategy proved superior, and I was extraordinarily warm all night. I slept soundly for nearly twelve hours, waking up around six in the morning, at first light.</p>

        <p>Upon entering Tamarack Canyon, I realized the day would be snowier than I had planned. The canyon was full of snow, due to its steep slopes that blocked the sun for a large part of the day. I trudged on about twelve inches of powder, and eventually made it to the OHV trails that would lead to the summit. These roads were even snowier than the canyon, making for slow travel. On top of this, eerie clouds filled the sky above, and I was worried that it would start snowing. I kept a quick pace, anxious about the weather. Eventually I made it to the summit ridge, which was largely snow-free due to its lack of vegetation and exposure to the sun for most of the day. The ridge was much longer than expected, and false summit after false summit eventually led to the true peak. Beautiful views of Death Valley stretched to my east, White Mountain towered over me to the north, and the Sierra greeted me to the west. I took in the spectacular views, ate some cheese, signed the summit register, and started descending. My freezing cold feet kept me from enjoying the summit for too long.</p>

        <p>The walk down was uneventful, but quite pretty. By the time I hit the main dirt road, the skies had cleared a bit, and the mindless tramping ensued. Several pleasant hours later, I found myself at the van. I made a large pot of pasta, scarfed it down, and slept soundly once again. Another successful mission in the Inyos.</p>
