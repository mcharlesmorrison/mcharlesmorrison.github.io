        <p><em>July 2017</em></p>

        <p>After finishing school for the year, I rallied out to Colorado for a huge trip - mountain biking from Denver to Durango via the Colorado Trail, a 486 mile trail (536 for bikers who have to take wilderness detours) with over 72,500 feet of climbing. I set an ambitious timeline of 13 days, and rolled out with a long time friend of mine, Daniel. Before starting, we stopped at Harleys: a Hotdog Revolution to get fueled up for the trip -- the owner was a rad dude who noted our next two weeks might get &quot;a little hairy and scary.&quot; Hairy and scary they were, but that's what made for such a rad ride.</p>

          <p>Prepared as we were, the long, arduous, and rain-storm filled first day got the better of Daniel. He was feeling pretty sick by nightfall, and not much better the next morning. As a result, we rode into the town of Bailey around mile 40, and Daniel hitched back to the car in Denver. I was now faced with the task of completing the trail alone. Fortunately, Daniel would link up with me a couple times here and there throughout the trip, giving me a much needed morale boost.</p>
          
          <p>The terrain was incredible and the riding was top notch: gnarly single track with a good mix of chunky rock gardens and wide open, lightning fast sections. Though with 20+ pounds on my back and an extra 15 pounds of gear hanging off my bike (I did not yet know the wonders of ultralight travel), I was slower than usual. I passed many thru-hikers and section-hikers along the way, rode with some other cyclists, and met some overall sick folks along the trail.</p>

        <p>After Daniel took off, there weren't anymore huge surprises, though the trip didn't go completely without a hitch. Thunderstorms are notorious for rolling in unexpectedly almost daily on the trail in the early afternoons. I was fortunate enough to only see rain for four days of the trip. </p>

          <p>When heavy storms rolled in, I would seek refuge under trees. Normally, the strategy seemed to work, though when the storm persisted for more than an hour all my gear would be soaked, and I would get quite cold. To remedy this, I would get back on the bike and ride to warm up.</p>

          <p>Other than the slight discomfort of precipitation, the only other hangups were two crashes resulting in some minor injuries (which I threw some water on and called good), as well as a (somewhat) blown out shock on my bike. The blown out shock could have been much worse -- but it held air for a few hours at a time so I'd carry a shock pump in my pocket and give it a pump every so often.</p>
        
          <p>The riding and the views progressively got more breathtaking as I made my way towards the end of the trail. I met a dude named Carlos somewhere in the San Juans. We rode together for a day and he gave me a lift into Silverton for a resupply. The San Juans are notoriously beautiful yet brutal for mountain bikers. I navigated them with relative success and was rewarded with beautiful wild flowers all the way til the end of the trail.</p>

          <p>12 days later (1 day ahead of schedule), I found myself in Durango, at the end of the Colorado trail. The photo below was actually about a mile from the &quot;real&quot; ending of the Colorado Trail. A local rider smugly mentioned this to me after taking my photo, so I biked down to the end and then climbed back up to my car in order to properly finish the entire trail.</p>
