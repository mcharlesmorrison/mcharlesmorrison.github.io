        <p><em>May-August 2019</em></p>

        <p>The summer of 2019 held many a twist and a turn. I had originally planned to bikepack across Arizona and Oregon, but a wedding I forgot about threw my schedule off. So, with a little over a week to plan, I decided to hit the Pacific Crest Trail, a 2,650 mile track from Mexico to Canada. The 84 days I spent on trail were some of the best of my life.</p>

        <p>My very limited writing skills and the sheer magnitude of epic stuff that happened on the trip make it hard to write a trip report. So I figured a video would do it a bit more justice. Enjoy:</p>
