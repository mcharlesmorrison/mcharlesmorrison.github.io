        <p><em>Peaks: Mount Cutler, Mount Muscoco</em></p>

        <p><em>December 2025</em></p>

        <p>We had uncharacteristically little snow in Colorado Springs over Christmas, so I took advantage by going on some easy peak bagging missions. One morning I ran from our house to Mount Cutler, an uneventful but stunning run through some beautiful alpine terrain. The summit offered excellent views of Colorado Springs to the east as well as deeper into the wilderness to the west.</p>

        <p>I had so much fun on Cutler that I dragged Lexi and mum out to Mount Muscoso the next morning. This time we drove to the trailhead and hiked the four-ish mile out and back up to the excellent summit of Muscoco. The girls seemed to enjoy the hike as much as I did which I was well pleased with. It was my first time in Colorado Springs and it certainly left a positive impression on me.</p>
