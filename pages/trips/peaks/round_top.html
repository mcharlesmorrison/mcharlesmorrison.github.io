        <p><em>June 2025</em></p>

        <p>On my way home from Tahoe, I decided to stop for a little jaunt up Round Top. Several friends had hiked it and they all claimed it to be a very pleasant hike and a fun scramble. I started sometime in the afternoon, and hiked towards the peak through beautiful country. Once at Round Top Lake the trail steepened considerably as it shot up for the west ridge. Once on the ridge I navigated and airy traverse, an awkward down climb, and a fun class three scramble to the summit. At the top I ate a bar and flipped through the summit register for several minutes finding five or six signature of friends in it. Moments like this really make the Sierra feel like home.</p>

        <p>The down climb proved a little trickier with my sore back, but went off relatively smoothly nonetheless. Soon I was trotting along on well defined trail back to the car. I jumped in the van and continued my drive home, stopping around sunset to camp on the side of the road for the night. Not bad for an after-work romp!</p>
