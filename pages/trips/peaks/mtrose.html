        <p><em>June 2025</em></p>

        <p>I was in Tahoe for work sometime in June and, despite some back pain, had resolved to climb at least a couple peaks while out there. And so, after a long day of work near Tahoe City, I set out for the Mt. Rose Trailhead. I car camped a mile or two down the road in an unmarked dirt lot. That night there were some pretty intense, albeit short, thunderstorms that made me slightly reticent about my hike.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, the clouds all cleared by morning and I was trotting up the trail by sunrise. By all measures it was an uneventful climb. I enjoyed pleasant jogging along mellow trails for miles. If my memory serves, it steepened up a little bit at the end. Views of the lake from the summit were excellent, but before long, I was trotting back down to the trailhead, as I had another full day of work ahead of me.</p>
